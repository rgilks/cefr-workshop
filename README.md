# CEFR Scoring with DeBERTa-v3

**Prerequisites**: Python basics, command line familiarity  
**Target Audience**: Software engineers new to ML

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (Do This First!)

### Prerequisites

**macOS users** - Install Python 3.12+ if you don't have it:
```bash
# Option 1: Using Homebrew (recommended)
brew install python@3.12

# Option 2: Download from python.org
# https://www.python.org/downloads/
```

**Install uv** - A fast Python package manager:
```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Or with Homebrew
brew install uv
```

### Setup

#### 1. Clone and Install
```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd cefr-workshop

# Install all dependencies (uv handles Python version automatically)
uv sync
```

#### 2. Verify Your Setup
```bash
# This should print "✅ Model test passed!" (downloads ~400MB model)
uv run python model.py
```

**What this tests**: This verifies that the pre-trained DeBERTa model downloads and loads correctly. You'll see "Sample scores" with random numbers like `[0.31, 0.08]` - these are **meaningless** because the regression head is untrained. After training, scores will be valid CEFR values (1.0-6.0).

#### 3. Prepare the Training Data

```bash
# Downloads and prepares the PELIC dataset (~38k essays)
uv run python prepare_data.py
```


#### 4. Set Up Modal (Cloud GPUs)
```bash
modal setup              # Follow the prompts to authenticate
modal run hello_modal.py # Verify Modal works (should print "Hello from modal!")
```

#### 5. Run Training
```bash
# Quick test first (~5 min, verifies everything works)
modal run train.py --test-run

# Then full training (~30-60 min on A10G GPU)
modal run train.py
```

You're all set! Continue to [Part 1](#part-1-understanding-the-problem) to learn what you're building, or skip ahead to [Part 6](#part-6-training--evaluation) if you just want to train.

## 🎯 What You'll Build

A machine learning model that reads English essays and predicts their CEFR level (A1→C2). By the end, you'll understand:

- How transformer models "read" text
- The training loop (forward pass → loss → backpropagation)
- Running GPU workloads on Modal
- Evaluating model quality with proper metrics

## Part 1: Understanding the Problem

### What is CEFR?

The **Common European Framework of Reference for Languages** (CEFR) is the international standard for describing language ability:

| Level | Description | Can Do |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **A1** | Beginner | Basic phrases, simple questions |
| **A2** | Elementary | Routine tasks, simple descriptions |
| **B1** | Intermediate | Main points, travel situations |
| **B2** | Upper-Intermediate | Complex texts, fluent interaction |
| **C1** | Advanced | Implicit meaning, flexible language |
| **C2** | Mastery | Effortless, precise expression |

### Why Automate This?

- Human scoring is expensive (~$10-50 per essay)
- Bottleneck for language learning platforms
- Models can provide instant feedback

### The ML Framing

This is a **regression problem**:
- **Input**: Essay text (string)
- **Output**: Score 1.0-6.0 (continuous, mapped to CEFR levels)


---

## Part 2: The Dataset

### PELIC Dataset (Recommended)

The **University of Pittsburgh English Language Institute Corpus (PELIC)** is our primary dataset for this workshop. It is an open dataset containing real essays from English learners.

- **~38,000 essays** (after filtering)
- **Levels A2-C1** (Note: Does not contain A1 or C2 examples)
- **Open License**: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0
- **Auto-download**: Our script handles everything.

### Obtaining the Data

```bash
# Downloads and prepares the PELIC dataset
uv run python prepare_data.py
```

### Data Structure

The PELIC dataset comes as a large CSV file. Our script filters it and converts it to JSONL format for training, mapping the internal levels (2-5) to CEFR (A2-C1).

### CEFR to Numeric Mapping

For regression, we convert CEFR to numbers:

```python
CEFR_TO_SCORE = {
    "A1": 1.0,
    "A2": 2.0,
    "B1": 3.0,
    "B2": 4.0,
    "C1": 5.0,
    "C2": 6.0,
}
```

> ⚠️ **Note on PELIC**: The PELIC dataset covers levels **A2 to C1**. It does not contain essays for A1 (Beginner) or C2 (Mastery). The model will still be able to predict adjacent scores, but may be less accurate at the extremes.

---

## Part 3: How DeBERTa Works

### The Big Picture

**DeBERTa-v3** is a pre-trained language model from Microsoft. Think of it as a "brain" that already understands English - it was trained on billions of words from the internet.

**What we do**: We add a small "scoring layer" on top and teach it to predict CEFR levels. This is called **fine-tuning** - we don't train the whole model from scratch, we just adjust it for our specific task.

```
Pre-trained DeBERTa (understands English)
         ↓
    Our scoring layer (learns CEFR)
         ↓
    CEFR Score (1.0 - 6.0)
```

### Why This Works

DeBERTa uses **attention** to understand context. For example, in "The bank by the river", it learns that "bank" relates to "river" (riverbank) rather than money.

This contextual understanding is exactly what's needed for CEFR scoring - the model can recognize patterns like:
- Simple vs complex sentence structures
- Basic vs advanced vocabulary
- Grammatical accuracy

## Part 4: Setting Up Modal

### What is Modal?

Modal is a cloud platform for running Python functions on GPUs. Think of it as "serverless for ML":

```python
@app.function(gpu="A10G")
def train():
    # This runs on a GPU in the cloud
    pass
```

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Install Modal
pip install modal

# 2. Authenticate (creates ~/.modal.toml)
modal setup

# 3. Verify
modal run --help
```

### Modal Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **App** | Container for your functions |
| **Image** | Docker-like environment specification |
| **Volume** | Persistent storage across runs |
| **Secret** | Secure credential storage |

### Your First Modal Script

Create `hello_modal.py`:

```python
import modal

app = modal.App("hello-workshop")

@app.function()
def hello():
    import platform
    return f"Hello from {platform.node()}!"

@app.local_entrypoint()
def main():
    print(hello.remote())
```

Run it:
```bash
modal run hello_modal.py
# Output: Hello from modal-runner-xxx!
```

---


## Part 5: Understanding the Code

The project contains four main Python files. Here's what each does:

### `prepare_data.py` - Data Preparation

Downloads and prepares the PELIC dataset for training:
- Auto-clones from GitHub
- Parses CSV and maps PELIC levels (2-5) to CEFR (A2-C1)
- Splits into train/dev/test JSONL files

**Key concept**: CEFR levels are converted to numbers for regression:
```python
CEFR_TO_SCORE = {"A1": 1.0, "A2": 2.0, "B1": 3.0, "B2": 4.0, "C1": 5.0, "C2": 6.0}
```

### `model.py` - Model Architecture

Defines the neural network:
- Loads pre-trained DeBERTa from Hugging Face
- Adds a "regression head" (small neural network) on top
- Outputs a score between 1.0-6.0

Run it to verify your setup: `uv run python model.py`

### `train.py` - Training Script

Runs on Modal with a GPU:
- Loads essays and tokenizes them
- Trains the model for 10 epochs
- Saves the best model based on validation MAE

**Modal decorators** make this run in the cloud:
```python
@app.function(gpu="A10G")  # Runs on an A10G GPU
def train():
    # Training code here
```

### `serve.py` - API Deployment

Deploys the trained model as a REST API:
- Loads the model from Modal volume
- Exposes `/score` endpoint for predictions
- Returns CEFR level and confidence

---

## Part 6: Training & Evaluation

### Running Training

```bash
# Quick test (verifies everything works, ~5 min)
modal run train.py --test-run

# Full training (~30-60 min)
modal run train.py
```

### Understanding the Output

```
Epoch 1/10
  Train Loss: 0.8234
  Dev MAE: 0.52
  ✅ New best model saved!

Epoch 2/10
  Train Loss: 0.4123
  Dev MAE: 0.41
  ✅ New best model saved!
  
...
```

**Key Metrics**:

| Metric | What It Means | Good Value |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| **Train Loss** | MSE on training data | Decreasing |
| **Dev MAE** | Mean Absolute Error on validation | < 0.5 |

### What is MAE?

**Mean Absolute Error** = average of `|predicted - actual|`

```python
# Example:
predictions = [3.2, 4.1, 2.8]
actuals     = [3.0, 4.0, 3.0]
errors      = [0.2, 0.1, 0.2]
MAE = average(errors) = 0.167
```

An MAE of 0.4 means predictions are within half a CEFR level on average.

### Running Evaluation

After training, test your model on held-out data:

```bash
modal run evaluate.py
```

The `evaluate.py` script:
- Loads your trained model from Modal volume
- Runs predictions on all test essays
- Reports MAE, QWK, and accuracy metrics

### Understanding QWK (Quadratic Weighted Kappa)

QWK measures agreement between predicted and actual CEFR levels:

| QWK Value | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|
| 1.0 | Perfect agreement |
| 0.8-1.0 | **Excellent** (human-level) |
| 0.6-0.8 | Good |
| 0.4-0.6 | Moderate |
| < 0.4 | Needs improvement |

> 💡 **Why QWK?** Unlike accuracy, QWK penalizes larger errors more. Predicting C2 when the actual is A2 is much worse than predicting B2.

## Part 7: Deployment & Inference

### Deploying the API

The `serve.py` file deploys your trained model as a REST API:

```bash
modal deploy serve.py
```

This gives you a persistent URL like `https://your-username--cefr-api-cefrservice-serve.modal.run`

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/health` | GET | Check if model is loaded |
| `/score` | POST | Score an essay |

### Testing the API

Try these sample essays at different CEFR levels:

**A1 Level** (very simple, fragmented):
```bash
curl -X POST https://YOUR-URL/score -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "I am student. I like school. My teacher is nice. I have friend. We play."}'
# Expected: A1-A2 (score ~1.7)
```

**A2 Level** (simple sentences, basic connectors):
```bash
curl -X POST https://YOUR-URL/score -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "I like to go shopping with my friends. We go to the mall every weekend. I usually buy clothes and sometimes we eat pizza. It is very fun."}'
# Expected: A2-B1 (score ~2.5)
```

**B1 Level** (connected, clear, personal topics):
```bash
curl -X POST https://YOUR-URL/score -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Last weekend I visited my grandmother. She lives in a small village near the mountains. We cooked dinner together and talked about old times. I really enjoyed spending time with her."}'
# Expected: B1 (score ~2.8)
```

**B2 Level** (clear, detailed, can argue a point):
```bash
curl -X POST https://YOUR-URL/score -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "The question of whether social media has had a positive or negative impact on society is complex. On one hand, platforms like Facebook have enabled unprecedented global connectivity. On the other hand, there is growing evidence that excessive use may contribute to mental health issues, particularly among young people."}'
# Expected: B2 (score ~3.8)
```

**C1/C2 Level** (sophisticated, nuanced):
```bash
curl -X POST https://YOUR-URL/score -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "The proliferation of misinformation in digital spaces represents a fundamental challenge to democratic discourse. While technological solutions such as fact-checking algorithms offer some mitigation, the underlying issue stems from deeper epistemological fragmentation in contemporary society."}'
# Expected: B2-C1 (score ~3.8) - Note: Model tends to underpredict C1/C2 due to limited training examples at these levels
```

## ⚠️ Known Limitations & Improvements

### The C1/C2 Problem

The model tends to underpredict C1 and C2 levels. In PELIC, this is exacerbated by the lack of C2 training data. This is a common data imbalance issue.

### Ways to Improve the Model

1. **Data augmentation**: Generate synthetic C1/C2 essays using GPT-4, or paraphrase existing ones
2. **Class weighting**: Weight the loss function to penalize C1/C2 errors more heavily
3. **[Ordinal regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08851)**: Use CORN or other ordinal loss functions that respect the A1→C2 ordering
4. **[Larger model](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/deberta-v3-large)**: Try `microsoft/deberta-v3-large` (304M params vs 86M)
5. **Ensemble**: Train 3-5 models with different seeds and average predictions
6. **Additional data**: Combine with other corpora - see [Additional Datasets](#-additional-datasets) below
